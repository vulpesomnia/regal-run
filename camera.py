'''
This file contains the camera system for the game.

The camera follows the player each frame by interpolating to the player's location.
Then all rendered objects are offset by the camera's location. This creates the illusion that the screen
is following the player. In conclusion all objects are just dragged to the screen with the player in the middle.
